/**
 * Like PintRNG (uses int math primarily, making it good with GWT and 32-bit machines) and FlapRNG, but with a longer
 * period than either, plus this implements StatefulRandomness. SlapRNG should have higher quality than FlapRNG based on
 * some rough metrics, but its period is known to be longer than FlapRNG's for most seeds, if not all. Precisely how
 * much longer isn't clear yet; this uses an irregular increment that depends on part of the current state, and it seems
 * possible that certain rare seeds have an effect on the length of the period. That said, the period should be at least
 * 2 to the 35 for most seeds, and is probably higher. This generator is not nearly as fast as FlapRNG, but it is
 * comparable to or faster than PintRNG (while having a longer (at least 8x) period, mainly thanks to more bits of
 * state). The mechanism by which this produces pseudo-randomness is somewhat unusual, and involves two state variables
 * as ints, one of which is used both before and after that state part changes. This slows down the generation slightly
 * due to a data dependency between the before and after states (the same problem most linear congruential generators
 * face), but seems to significantly improve period. It should be noted that for cases where you only generate 32-bit
 * ints, SlapRNG provides one of the best combinations of quality, period, compatibility, and speed that we have, with
 * other generators beating it on some of those but not all of them. FlapRNG is faster by about 2x, but sacrifices
 * quality and period. PintRNG has better quality, is about the same speed and has a lower period. Other generators give
 * up efficient compatibility with GWT due to long math (which is slower and probably produces garbage on GWT), though
 * many are faster on PCs (LapRNG and ThunderRNG, for instance).
